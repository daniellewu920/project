        <h2>
          Famous Orchestrators
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Richard Wagner
        </h3>
        <p>
          Having written "Salome", "Elektra", and "Alpine Symphony", Strauss is
          known to be one of the greatest orchestrators in <br />
          classical music literature. A German composer, born in 1864, Strauss
          is known for some of the most well-known operas and <br />
          large orchestral works to date. His orchestrations will make the music
          come alive in the hall.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Maurice Ravel
        </h3>
        <p>
          Known for his famous works, "Daphnis et Chloe", "Bolero", and "Le
          Tombeau de Couperin", Ravel was known as one of the <br />
          greatest orchestrators in the 20th century. He even went and
          orchestrated Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition", which <br />
          was originally written for solo piano. A French composer, conductor,
          and pianist born in 1875, Ravel soon became one of the <br />
          biggest inspirations of composers in the 21st century.
        </p>
        <h3>Gustav Mahler</h3>
        <p>
          Well known for his symphonies and song cycles, Gustav Mahler is one of the best orchestrators in all <br>
          of music history. Having written his historic and momentous Second Symphony, Mahler soon established <br>
          himself as an amazing orchestrator. However, in his time, he was not as well known as he is today. Leonard <br>
          Bernstein made all of Mahler's works as well known as they are today. Mahler is regularly programmed on all <br>
          top orchestras around the world.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Dmitri Shostakovich
        </h3>
        <p>
          Shostakovich is personally one of my favorite composers of all time. He is also one of the best orchestrators <br>
          of all time. He has written 15 symphonies, all that tell a brilliant story. His use of harmony and timbre really <br>
          define his style and his distinct sound. Once you listen to one Shosty symphony, you'll recognize his style immediately
        </p>
        <h3>
          Igor Stravinsky
        </h3>
        <p>
          In addition to his orchestral pieces, Stravinsky wrote 3 brilliant ballets: Firebird, Petrouchka, and Rite of Spring. <br>
          All tell very intricate stories. The orchestration of these ballets are very large. They are very famous in using <br>
          auxiliary instruments for the winds and a plethora of percussion. Stravinsky also wrote a couple symphonies and some <br>
          general orchestra pieces. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          ...and those are just to name a few! In music history and orchestration, we study a plethora of composers and how they
          used standard orchestral instruments in the context of a big work. We study them and we learn from them by doing the
          thing we do most: listen. By simply listening to these pieces, you can learn <br> so much about how deeply intricate and
          sophisticated these orchestrations are.
