                Richard Strauss
              </h3>
              <p>
                Having written "Salome", "Elektra", and "Alpine Symphony",
                Strauss is known to be one of the greatest orchestrators in
                classical music literature. A German composer, born in 1864,
                Strauss is known for some of the most well-known operas and
                large orchestral works to date. His orchestrations will make the
                music come alive in the hall.

              <p>
                Known for his famous works, "Daphnis et Chloe", "Bolero", and
                "Le Tombeau de Couperin", Ravel was known as one of the greatest
                orchestrators in the 20th century. He even went and orchestrated
                Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition", which was originally
                written for solo piano. A French composer, conductor, and
                pianist born in 1875, Ravel soon became one of the biggest
                inspirations of composers in the 21st century.

              <h3>Gustav Mahler</h3>
              <p>
                Well known for his symphonies and song cycles, Gustav Mahler is
                one of the best orchestrators in all of music history. Having
                written his historic and momentous Second Symphony, Mahler soon
                established himself as an amazing orchestrator. However, in his
                time, he was not as well known as he is today. Leonard Bernstein
                made all of Mahler's works as well known as they are today.
                Mahler is regularly programmed on all top orchestras around the
                world.

                Dmitri Shostakovich
              </h3>
              <p>
                Shostakovich is personally one of my favorite composers of all
                time. He is also one of the best orchestrators of all time. He
                has written 15 symphonies, all that tell a brilliant story. His
                use of harmony and timbre really define his style and his
                distinct sound. Once you listen to one Shosty symphony, you'll
                recognize his style immediately

                Igor Stravinsky
              </h3>
              <p>
                In addition to his orchestral pieces, Stravinsky wrote 3
                brilliant ballets: Firebird, Petrouchka, and Rite of Spring.
                <br />
                All tell very intricate stories. The orchestration of these
                ballets are very large. They are very famous in using auxiliary
                instruments for the winds and a plethora of percussion.
                Stravinsky also wrote a couple symphonies and some general
                orchestra pieces.

                ...and those are just to name a few! In music history and
                orchestration, we study a plethora of composers and how they
                used standard orchestral instruments in the context of a big
                work. We study them and we learn from them by doing the thing we
                do most: listen. By simply listening to these pieces, you can
                learn so much about how deeply intricate and sophisticated these
                orchestrations are.
