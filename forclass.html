<h2>
  Famous Orchestrators
</h2>
<p>
  <h3>
    Richard Wagner
</h3>
Having written "Salome", "Elektra", and "Alpine Symphony", Strauss is known to be one of the greatest orchestrators in <br>
classical music literature. A German composer, born in 1864, Strauss is known for some of the most well-known operas and <br>
large orchestral works to date. His orchestrations will make the music come alive in the hall.
</p>
<h3>
  Maurice Ravel
</h3>
<p>
  Known for his famous works, "Daphnis et Chloe", "Bolero", and "Le Tombeau de Couperin", Ravel was known as one of the <br>
  greatest orchestrators in the 20th century. He even went and orchestrated Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition", which <br>
  was originally written for solo piano. A French composer, conductor, and pianist born in 1875, Ravel soon became one of the <br>
  biggest inspirations of composers in the 21st century.
